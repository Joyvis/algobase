## Why does this project exist?

AlgoBase was born from the desire to create **educational, accessible, and straight-to-the-point** material that goes beyond theory and actually helps you grow as a developer.

Each problem was carefully chosen to represent recurring patterns in technical interviews and challenges, with **clear explanations, structured approaches, complexity analysis, and clean code**.
