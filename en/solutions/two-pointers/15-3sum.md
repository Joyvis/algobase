# 👆👆 15. 3Sum

## 🧠 Intuition

We need to find all triplets that sum to zero. The idea is to **sort the array** and use the two-pointer technique: for each element, we search for two others that complete the sum. Sorting allows us to skip duplicates and use two pointers efficiently.

## ⚙️ Approach

1. Sort the array
2. For each element `nums[i]`:
   - Skip if it's a duplicate of the previous
   - Use two pointers: `left = i + 1`, `right = n - 1`
   - While `left < right`:
     - Calculate sum of the three elements
     - If sum == 0: add triplet, move both pointers, skip duplicates
     - If sum < 0: move `left` to the right
     - If sum > 0: move `right` to the left

## ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time**: O(n^2) - For each element, we use two pointers in O(n)
- **Space**: O(1) or O(n) depending on sorting algorithm
